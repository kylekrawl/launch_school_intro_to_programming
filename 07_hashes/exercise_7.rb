# 7.  Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

#   What's the difference between 
#   the two hashes that were created?

# my_hash uses the symbol :x as a key for the value "some
# value", while my_hash2 uses the string value that the
# variable x is pointing to ("hi there") as the key.
