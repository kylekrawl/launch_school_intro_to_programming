# 11. Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say 
#     which one you like best and why.

# I prefer the official documentation site (ruby-doc.org) 
# for Ruby's core and standard libraries. It's logically 
# organized, easy to navigate, and provides links to other 
# useful resources for beginners (e.g. style guides and 
# books on learning Ruby).
