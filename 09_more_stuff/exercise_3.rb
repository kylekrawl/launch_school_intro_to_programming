# 3.  What is exception handling and what problem does it 
#     solve?

# Exception handling is a tool used to control a 
# program's response to an error during execution. It 
# allows the program to perform a specified set of 
# actions in response to the occurence of an error, 
# changing flow control such that the program is not 
# exited when the error occurs.
